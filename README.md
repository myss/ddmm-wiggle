Dual Display Mouse Manager, with mouse wiggling support

This is a version of the original [Dual Display Mouse Manager](http://ddmm.sourceforge.net/), which also adds support for crossing screen borders by wiggling the mouse a few times. The goal is to reduce accidental switches between screens, without needing to resort to the keyboard.
